            <h2>Deep Water Soloing</h2>
            
            
            <h3>What is Deep Water Soloing?</h3>
            <p>
                Deep Water Soloing (DWS), also known as psicobloc, is a form of free solo rock climbing that takes place on cliffs above deep water. The water serves as protection in case of a fall, eliminating the need for ropes, harnesses, or other protective gear. This style combines the freedom of free soloing with the relative safety of landing in water.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History of Deep Water Soloing</h3>
            <p>
                While climbers have likely been climbing over water for decades, DWS emerged as a recognized discipline in the 1970s in Mallorca, Spain. The term "psicobloc" was coined by Miquel Riera, who pioneered many routes on the island. The sport gained international attention in the early 2000s through media coverage and films featuring climbers like Chris Sharma on the dramatic sea cliffs of Mallorca.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Key Features of Deep Water Soloing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Protection:</strong> Water replaces traditional safety equipment</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Freedom:</strong> Combines the mental aspects of free soloing with reduced consequences</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal Activity:</strong> Typically practiced in warmer months and locations</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Tides, water depth, and wave conditions are critical safety considerations</li>
                <li><strong>Grading:</strong> Often uses standard climbing grades with additional height/danger considerations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Essential Deep Water Soloing Gear</h3>
            <p>
                DWS requires minimal equipment, but specific considerations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Climbing shoes (that can get wet)</li>
                <li>Quick-drying clothes/swimwear</li>
                <li>Chalk bag (waterproof if possible)</li>
                <li>Dry bag for belongings</li>
                <li>Approach shoes for rocky coastlines</li>
                <li>Towel and dry clothes for after climbing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Safety Considerations for Deep Water Soloing</h3>
            <p>
                While DWS eliminates the need for traditional protection, it comes with its own safety concerns:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Depth:</strong> Always check water depth before climbing - minimum 3-4 meters for lower routes</li>
                <li><strong>Tides:</strong> Be aware of changing tides that can affect water depth and exit points</li>
                <li><strong>Entry/Exit Points:</strong> Identify safe ways to enter and exit the water</li>
                <li><strong>Submerged Hazards:</strong> Check for rocks or other obstacles below the water</li>
                <li><strong>Fall Technique:</strong> Learn to fall safely - pencil dive from height, arms at sides</li>
                <li><strong>Weather Conditions:</strong> Wind and waves can make climbing and water landings dangerous</li>
                <li><strong>Swimming Ability:</strong> Strong swimming skills are essential</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Competitions and Events</h3>
            <p>

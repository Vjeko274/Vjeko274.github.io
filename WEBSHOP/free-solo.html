                <h4>⚠️ EXTREME DANGER WARNING ⚠️</h4>
                <p>
                    Free soloing is potentially lethal and should NEVER be attempted by anyone except the most experienced climbers with years of practice. Even elite climbers consider this activity extremely high-risk. We provide this information for educational purposes only and strongly discourage attempting this discipline.
                </p>

            <h3>What is Free Solo Climbing?</h3>
            <p>
                Free solo climbing is a form of rock climbing where the climber performs alone without using any ropes, harnesses, or other protective equipment, relying solely on their physical and mental abilities. Unlike bouldering, which is performed at relatively low heights with crash pads, or deep water soloing, which uses water for protection, free soloing offers no safety net whatsoever.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History of Free Solo Climbing</h3>
            <p>
                While climbers have been soloing difficult routes for decades, the discipline gained mainstream attention through climbers like Alex Honnold, whose free solo of El Capitan's 3,000-foot "Freerider" route was documented in the Oscar-winning film "Free Solo." Other notable free soloists include John Bachar, Peter Croft, and Catherine Destivelle, each pushing the boundaries of what was thought humanly possible.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Mental Game</h3>
            <p>
                Free soloing is as much a mental discipline as a physical one. Elite free soloists describe entering a state of hyper-focus where distractions disappear and complete concentration is achieved. This requires:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exceptional emotional control and ability to manage fear</li>
                <li>Complete mastery of climbing techniques</li>
                <li>Intimate knowledge of the route, often gained through dozens of roped ascents</li>
                <li>The ability to make split-second decisions with perfect clarity</li>
                <li>A unique relationship with risk that few people possess</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why We Don't Sell Free Solo "Gear"</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike other climbing disciplines, free soloing requires no specialized equipment beyond climbing shoes and chalk. However, we believe it would be irresponsible to market products specifically for free soloing or to encourage this extremely dangerous activity in any way.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Alternatives to Consider</h3>
            <p>
                If you're drawn to the purity and simplicity of free soloing, consider these safer alternatives that can provide similar experiences:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep Water Soloing:</strong> Climb without ropes above deep water</li>
                <li><strong>Bouldering:</strong> Experience ropeless climbing at safer heights</li>
                <li><strong>Solo Top-Roping:</strong> Use self-belay devices for a solo experience with protection</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional Climbing:</strong> Experience adventure and self-reliance with proper protection</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Famous Free Solo Ascents</h3>

                <h4>Final Reminder</h4>
                <p>
